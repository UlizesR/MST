# MacOS System Tools (MST)

A simple C library to allow a user to get information on their Mac system such as cpu, memory and processes.

## Note:

Not very accurate in some aspects

The number of active processes by the systems doesnt seem to match that provided by the activity monitor. Its close but not exact.

Same for CPU sytem usage.
